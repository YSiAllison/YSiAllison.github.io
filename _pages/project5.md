## Project 1: Terrain Identification from wearable device signals using Neural Networks ([Report](https://github.com/YSiAllison/YSiAllison.github.io/blob/master/files/The%20prediction%20for%20terrain%20identification.pdf))

We composed four different neural network architectures to predict a categorical distribution of terrain types.
select the best model based on accuracy in the validation set.

The models we used were: 
  a Fully-connected Neural Network(FNN), 
  
  a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), 
  
  a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network, 
  
  and a Transformer Neural Network(TransNN).
**Results and Conclusion**  LSTM model has the highest accuracy in validation set.
