My name is Allison (Yaqin) Si. Currently I am PhD Research Assistant in Biosinformatics at North Carolina State University. I have in-depth interdisciplinary training spanning epidemiology, statistics, and bioinformatics. My research centers on developing and applying statistical methods for analyzing genomics and healthcare datasets to investigate disease risks. I also serve as a statistical representative in cross-functional teams, identify and resolve technical problems, add value to development programs, analyze and interpret data, communicate results, and contribute to research on innovative statistical methods.

My doctoral training focus on statistical genetics co-advised by [Dr. Jung-Ying Tzeng](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~jytzeng/) and [Dr. Wenbin Lu](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~wlu4//) at NC State University. [Dr. Wan-Ping Lee](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9374322) and [Dr. Hui Wang](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9545985) provide valuable insights in guiding my research work. My dissertation focuses on method development for DNA copy number variants (CNV) association analysis, motivated by the challenges of multiple features of CNV, such as type, dosage, and  length, across a large genomic region (typically one chromosome arm). I developed penalized regression models that incorporate line-graph-guided penalties (Weighted Fusion) alongside Lasso to perform variable selection and effect estimation of phenotype-associated structural variants. To evaluate these methods, I designed extensive simulation studies assessing statistical power, estimation accuracy, and robustness relative to existing approaches. This work is currently under revision at the Annals of Applied Statistics. During my Ph.D. study, I also obtained Master of Statistics with statistics PhD-level projects and course training. My have Bachelor's degrees in Preventative Medicine and Economics (co-major).

A central aspect of my training is taking projects from idea to usable software. I translated my methodological work into CNVreg, an R package released on CRAN for genome-wide CNV association analysis, complete with documentation and reproducible vignettes. By the end of 2025, CNVreg had accumulated over 1,600 downloads, highlighting both community interest and my commitment to open, reproducible research. Through this process, I gained substantial experience building scalable pipelines for large-scale genomic data. I am currently preparing a companion manuscript for the Journal of Statistical Software to further document the computational and methodological contributions. 

Key strengths I am equipped with from my experience collaborating with engineers, analysts, and domain experts:

  * Technical skills:
    * statistical modeling and interpretation
    * machine learning and deep learning
    * model training and validation workflow
    * tool development: R package
    * strong programming skills using R, Python and SAS
    * data visualization
    * experience with AWS and HPC environments

  * Soft skills:
    * strong writing/communication using technical and non-technical language.
    * productive interdisciplinary teamwork
    * efficient time and task management
